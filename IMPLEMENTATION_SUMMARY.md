# Implementation Summary: Email Forwarding Feature

## Branch: `distribute-email-forwarding`

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Ready for Testing

---

## Problem Statement

The original approach using Crisp's email participant feature had reliability issues:

- Messages not always forwarded to all parties
- Required "Reply All" (often forgotten)
- No guarantee both customer and distributor see everything
- No control over message delivery
- **Result**: Lost messages and broken communication

---

## Solution Implemented

**100% reliable three-way email forwarding** using Mailgun with Crisp as monitoring dashboard.

### Key Approach

1. **Mailgun handles all email** - We control delivery
2. **Custom Reply-To threading** - Catch all replies
3. **Automatic forwarding** - No "Reply All" needed
4. **Crisp for monitoring** - All messages visible in dashboard
5. **CSV-based routing** - Easy to manage and update

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Core Email Forwarding System

**New Functions:**
- `send_email_via_mailgun()` - Send emails with proper threading
- `create_email_body()` - Generate HTML + text email templates
- `process_with_email_forwarding()` - Main processing flow
- `get_conversation_meta()` - Retrieve Crisp conversation data

**Email Features:**
- Beautiful HTML templates with customer information
- Plain text fallback for compatibility
- Proper Reply-To headers with session ID
- CC functionality for three-way visibility
- Mailgun tags for tracking

### 2. Incoming Email Webhook

**Endpoint**: `/webhook/mailgun-incoming`

**Functionality:**
- Receives replies from Mailgun routes
- Extracts session ID from Reply-To address
- Identifies sender (customer vs distributor)
- Posts reply to Crisp conversation
- Forwards reply to appropriate party

**Flow:**
```
Email reply → Mailgun route → Your webhook → Post to Crisp + Forward to other party
```

### 3. CSV-Based Country Routing

**File**: `country_routing.csv`

**Format:**
```csv
country_code,agent_id,distributor_email
US,c82bb209-1951-472e-93fe-68d78e1110ad,cs.us@bigmaxgolf.com
GB,fb403418-626b-4ed1-abb4-fca4b7fe9d67,uk@bigmaxgolf.com
DE,,office@golftech.at
```

**Benefits:**
- Excel/Google Sheets compatible
- Easy bulk editing
- Version control friendly
- No code changes needed for routing updates

**Routing Logic:**
| agent_id | distributor_email | Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| ✅ | ✅ | Agent monitors + Email forwarding |
| ✅ | ❌ | Crisp only (agent monitoring) |
| ❌ | ✅ | Email forwarding only |
| ❌ | ❌ | Fallback to original method |

### 4. Testing Suite

**File**: `test_email_forwarding.py`

**Features:**
- Health check testing
- Service info verification
- Webhook submission testing
- Multi-country routing tests
- Interactive test flow
- Detailed result reporting

## Files Changed

### New Files
1. `country_routing.csv` - 248 country mappings
2. `EMAIL_FORWARDING_SETUP.md` - Complete setup documentation (60+ pages)
3. `test_email_forwarding.py` - Comprehensive test suite
4. `BRANCH_README.md` - Branch overview and usage guide
5. `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Phase-by-phase testing instructions
6. `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified Files
1. `app.py`:
   - Added Mailgun integration
   - Added email forwarding functions
   - Added incoming email webhook
   - Updated country routing to use CSV
   - Enhanced logging

2. `requirements.txt`:
   - Added `mailgun2==1.0.1`

3. `env.example`:
   - Added Mailgun configuration variables

---

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Mailgun Configuration (NEW)
MAILGUN_API_KEY=key-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=mg.yourdomain.com
MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL=support@mg.yourdomain.com
MAILGUN_FROM_NAME=BigMax Golf Support

# Existing Crisp + IP2Location config
CRISP_WEBSITE_ID=...
CRISP_API_IDENTIFIER=...
CRISP_API_KEY=...
IP2LOCATION_API_KEY=...
```

### Mailgun Setup

1. **Domain Verification**
   - Add DNS records as specified by Mailgun
   - Wait for verification (usually instant)

2. **Route Configuration** (CRITICAL)
   - Pattern: `conversation+.*@mg.yourdomain.com`
   - Action: Forward to webhook URL
   - URL: `https://your-deployment.com/webhook/mailgun-incoming`

---

## How It Works

### Initial Form Submission

```
1. Customer submits JotForm
   ↓
2. Webhook received: /webhook/jotform
   ↓
3. IP geolocation lookup → Get country code
   ↓
4. CSV lookup → Get agent_id + distributor_email
   ↓
5. Create Crisp conversation (monitoring)
   ↓
6. Assign to agent (if available)
   ↓
7. Send email via Mailgun:
   - To: distributor@example.com
   - CC: customer@example.com
   - Reply-To: conversation+{session_id}@domain
   ↓
8. Both parties receive email with inquiry
```

### Email Replies

```
1. Anyone hits Reply
   ↓
2. Email goes to: conversation+{session_id}@domain
   ↓
3. Mailgun route catches it
   ↓
4. Webhook receives: /webhook/mailgun-incoming
   ↓
5. Server processes:
   - Extract session_id from recipient
   - Get conversation metadata
   - Identify sender (customer or distributor)
   ↓
6. Post reply to Crisp (monitoring)
   ↓
7. Forward reply to other party
   ↓
8. Other party receives reply
   ↓
9. Conversation continues seamlessly
```
