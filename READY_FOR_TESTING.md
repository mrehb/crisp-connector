## Known Issues & Limitations

### None Currently

All known issues were addressed during implementation:
- âœ… Session ID extraction working
- âœ… Sender identification working
- âœ… Reply forwarding working
- âœ… Error handling implemented
- âœ… Fallback scenarios covered

### Potential Considerations

1. **Mailgun Rate Limits**
   - Free tier: 1,000 emails/month
   - Monitor usage
   - Upgrade if needed

2. **Email Delivery Times**
   - Typically 1-30 seconds
   - Dependent on recipient servers
   - Monitor in Mailgun logs

3. **Spam Filters**
   - Configure SPF/DKIM/DMARC
   - Monitor bounce rates
   - Maintain good sender reputation
