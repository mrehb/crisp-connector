# Railway Setup Instructions

Your project is ready to deploy! Since Railway CLI requires interactive mode, please follow these steps:

## Step 1: Link Your Local Project

In your terminal, run:

```bash
cd "/Users/maxi/Desktop/Crisp Connector"
railway link
```

Select:
- Workspace: **mrehb's Projects**
- Project: **crisp-connector**

## Step 2: Set Environment Variables

After linking, set your environment variables:

```bash
railway variables set CRISP_WEBSITE_ID=your-website-id
railway variables set CRISP_API_IDENTIFIER=your-api-identifier
railway variables set CRISP_API_KEY=your-api-key
railway variables set IP2LOCATION_API_KEY=your-ip2location-key
```

Or add them in the Railway dashboard:
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Open your **crisp-connector** project
3. Click on **Variables**
4. Add each variable

## Step 3: Deploy

Since your project is linked to GitHub, Railway will automatically deploy when you push to main.

Or manually deploy:

```bash
railway up
```

## Step 4: Get Your Deployment URL

```bash
railway open
```

This will open your Railway dashboard. Find your deployment URL (something like `https://crisp-connector-production.up.railway.app`)

## Step 5: Configure JotForm

Use your Railway URL in JotForm webhook settings:

```
https://your-app.up.railway.app/webhook/jotform
```

## Environment Variables Needed

| Variable | Where to Get It |
|----------|----------------|
| `CRISP_WEBSITE_ID` | Crisp Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Website Settings |
| `CRISP_API_IDENTIFIER` | Crisp Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ API |
| `CRISP_API_KEY` | Crisp Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ API |
| `IP2LOCATION_API_KEY` | https://www.ip2location.io/dashboard |

## Verify Deployment

Check if your service is running:

```bash
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "service": "Crisp Integration"
}
```

## View Logs

```bash
railway logs
```

**All set!** ðŸš€ Your app will auto-deploy from GitHub whenever you push changes.
